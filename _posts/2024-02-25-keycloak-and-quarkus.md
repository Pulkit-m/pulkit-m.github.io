As you would find on Quarkus' website, it is a supersonic and subatomic framework. Well so should be your project. What is it that is required in every project, and is of utmost importance -- Security. Who should be allowed into your application (Authentication), and what should he/she be allowed to see or do (Authorization)? This is where Quarkus Security comes into picture, or you could say Spring Security in case of Spring Framework. Instead of handling all that in our application, we can use KeyCloak to provide authentication and authorization services for our application. Its similar to using OAuth2 with Google. In KeyCloak there are a number of other methods other than OAuth2 with which you can authenticate your application.
