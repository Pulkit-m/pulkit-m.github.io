A month after I graduated from college, my Juniors asked me to deliver an introductory talk on some advanced topic in Artificial Intelligence. I always wanted to explore Reinforcement learning for myself as well, so I decided that this would indeed be my topic for the talk. I covered basics of Reinforcement Learning, like MDPs, Policies and Value Functions, Q-Learning, Exploration v/s Exploitation, demonstrated some simulations, and briefly touched Deep Q-Learning.
