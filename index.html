Hi I'm Pulkit Mahajan, and you've landed on my homepage. I'm currently working as a Software Developer at HDFC Bank. I graduated from IIT Jammu in May 2023, finishing my bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. This page is currently under work, so please be patient. I hope to go fully live by end of February. Meanwhile you can still stroll around all the mess that I've been putting out here on this page...

<h2>From my notes...</h2>
This section is all about the things that I find awesome. You may find things here that I'm really good at, have spent time in learning or might have stumbled accross while exploring something somewhere. You can scroll through and see if there is something might help you. I sometimes treat this page as a kind of obsidian pro version that's synced accross all my devices, so I can refer my notes all the time. ðŸ˜…
